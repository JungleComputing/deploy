Currently gathered statistics are on a per-site basis.
(as opposed to on a per-pool or per-node basis)

When an ibis is added to a pool (or removed)
- we reinitialize the entire data objects tree
- we do a single update cycle in that pool with necessary statistics, otherwise we cannot make a visualization of links etc.

A node is identified primarily by its IbisIdentifier.
- a node can be a part of multiple pools
- a node is part of a single site

A site is identified primarily by its string representation;
- a site can be a part of multiple pools

A pool is identified primarily by its string representation;

A link exists between two nodes

A trunk is a network link between two sites
